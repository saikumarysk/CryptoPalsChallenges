# CryptoPalsChallenges

These are my solutions in Python for the online cryptography puzzles, [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/), also known as Matasano Cryptopals challenges.

All the solutions are in Python 3.5. Please install the 'crypto' library if you want to execute them.

Although there are 8 sets, I have completed 7 and working on set 8. Set 8 involves Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and the questions are removed from the website. We have to send a mail to set8.cryptopals@gmail.com to receive the questions. I received the questions and currently working on them.
